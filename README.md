# TobaERP. an iDempiere distribution by Toba Consulting Services

While working on our projects, very oftenly we need to develop features that can only resides within the iDempiere core repository. We decided to centralized all of our 

core development here. Some of it will be proposed to be included in iDempiere and some might just stay here. 

Hence this is the official **base** iDempiere core repo that we will be using for all of our clients. 

Note that we mentioned **base** as some clients might have some local customizations added on top of this **base** core.
